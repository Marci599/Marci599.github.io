            <h3>Short story</h3>

            <p>I've been interested in programming since childhood. I started with Scratch and later switched to the
                Unity game engine. It was a big leap, but I never regretted it. Besides programming, I enjoy graphic
                design, video editing, animation, UI/UX design, and I love organizing collaborative projects.</p>
            <p>The only problem I have is that when I come up with three big ideas, I want to make all of them, which can feel impossible to handle alone as a hobby.</p>
            <p>I confidently use C#, Python, and Kotlin, and I've experimented with several other languages as
                well.</p>
      

            <h3>Some of my programs</h3>

                    <div>
                        <p>The plan is to build an advanced, automated student hostel system. There are currently
                            seven of us working on it, and we're aiming to include every function a dormitory needs to
                            operate smoothly. The platform will help teachers and students by tracking attendance and
                            movement permissions, managing leave requests, room inspections, canteen data, and
                            generating useful statistics. We're developing it for the web as well as Android and iOS.</p>
                        <p>I originally came up with the idea because the outdated paper-based process frustrated me, and I
                            felt we could create something better ourselves. That is certainly true; however, I seriously underestimated the amount of time required, as at the beginning of the project we lacked concrete experience in many fields.</p>

                        <p>This was one of my main projects before Koller, and it's still my dream game. It's a 3D
                            survival adventure set deep underground. It already features an inventory plus health and
                            save systems that also reliably preserve moved or dropped world items / objects. A base-building system is in progress,
                            and I'd like to add voxel-based terraforming like in Donkey Kong Bananza,
                            which feels perfect for a cave setting.</p>
                        <p>Originally, I worked on it with my classmates, but the team eventually dissolved and I kept
                            the project alive on my own.</p>
                        <p>I'm looking forward to finishing my other half-complete projects (or handing them over) so I
                            can fully focus on this one again, probably with my friends.</p>

                        <p>This was my first relatively big game, so it isn't a game-changer; it's more of a classic
                            platformer with a few twists. I lost the Unity project file, so I started rebuilding it in
                            the Godot engine and plan to remove every paywall.</p>

                        <p>A tool I built for a fan game to make implementing frames much easier.</p>
                        <p>It automatically generates spritesheet resources from individual recorded or rendered frames. The tool removes the background, crops sprites based on a chosen color and threshold, resizes and offsets them, and arranges everything according to the user's configuration.</p>
                        <p>I created it for a Mario fan game (Mario Multiverse SFMB) I've contributed to since 2020 to automate the spritesheet workflow. I originally wrote a simple Python script that just read manually set config files and generated based on them, but I ended up building a full UI for it in Python. I'm currently remaking it in WinUI 3 and C# so I can take advantage of a native UI toolkit and add real-time previews for example.</p>

                        <p>I made this game for the 2022 GMTK Game Jam. It's a very short (and very buggy) strategy
                            game that I made in no more than two days. It was my first game jam, one of my first project
                            without much 3D experience, and even the first time using Unity's new UI Toolkit, which I was
                            surprised that I was able to learn on the fly.</p>
                        <p>There's not much reason to play it right now, I consider it a failure. I might revisit it one
                            day, but I don't currently have plans for it.</p>
                        <p>I really liked the tight deadline, which is why I joined. I really value my time and I'm afraid of doing something without thinking it through beforehand, so I felt that whatever the outcome of those two days I wouldn't lose much, but I would definitely learn from the experience.</p>

                        <p>We probably lost because we tried to look too professional instead of being funny, which

                            as many campaign videos, posters, and programs as possible.  But in the end, we won big! Organizing the actual student day
                            became the new challenge, and we had very little prep time, so I often stayed up until dawn

                        <p>This was my last significant middle school project. We initially wanted to have a 
                            professional to shoot the photos, design the board, and handle printing. I offered to design
                            it myself, but because that wouldn't have lowered the bundle price I let it go, until I kept
                            revisiting his portfolio and realized how bad and repetitive it looked. Even though he told me I
                            probably couldn't do it, at the end I organized the entire process: another photographer handled the
                            shoot, I designed the board, and we printed it elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>
                            Later it turned out that the photographer tried to
                            mislead and scam us, but luckily I got the digital photos beforehand, paid the agreed amount, and did the retouching
                            myself. Everything came together just in time, so seems like I can make custom graduation boards too!</p>
                        <p>The design is themed after the Steam video-game platform.</p>
