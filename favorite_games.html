                    <p>Not only my favorite to this day, but it was also the very first serious game I played on the Nintendo Wii. I still have the original console and the disc to this day, but I don't use it anymore, because I can produce much better quality with emulation. But I have it on disc that we paid for so don't sue me!</p>
                    <p>This is a 3D Mario platformer game and one of the huge differences from any other 3D platformers is that the gravity is almost never only downwards. Either we are on small planets, where gravity constantly pulls us towards the center, or we are on all kinds of other interesting shapes with their own unique gravity. Sometimes there are also separate gravitational fields, where everything might turn upside down and in other places gravity changes to a rhythm, etcetera. Another interesting thing about the game is that at the beginning of the story, we get a special Luma star, which provides a spin attack ability, which can be activated by shaking the Wii remote control. This will keep us up in the air for a few secs and you can also destroy and break all kind of things or even change the layout of some of the stages with each shake.</p>
                    <p>The game also contains mayn other new unigue things. I wholeheartedly recommend it to those who like 3D platformers. (It can also be really hard at some places)</p>

            <p>This is a Nintendo Wii platformer game too, but this one was made by Ubisoft. I also have this on disk</p>
            <p>In this game you play with 3 crazy Rabbids from many. The game has quite an interesting (and crazy) story, if I understood correctly, they sleep on spherical streetlamps and one night they noticed the moon, which they thought was also a lamp, except that it was huge. They came up with a plan to build a huge tower to reach it. But since they don't have enough materials, they have come up with the idea of stealing everything they can from people and using that to build the tower. The interesting thing about the game is that you can't jump in it. You rob the humanity with a shopping cart with another rabbid in it.</p>
            <p>Overall a very crazy but funny game with very creative levels.</p>

            <p>I first started playing this game with my dad on our old XP PC.</p>
            <p>In this game, you have to use a bunch of strange little goo balls to build bridges, towers and all kind of shapes, but not like in the usual bridge building games, nothing drives over it after we are done. There is a starting point and you have to build some tipe of bridge with the balls to a pipe. These balls are constantly crawling on our bridge or on the map until we use them for the construction. One of the goals of the game is to use as few balls as possible, because the rest is sucked up by the pipe, which we can then use to build a huge tower in a separate map</p>
            <p>The game is full of creative levels and has a very interesting and deep story. I can't wait for part two!</p>

            <p>I discovered this game when I was still in elementary school. I don't remember from where, but I really enjoyed it.</p>
            <p>This is a 3D puzzle game from Valve. The main idea in the game is that you have a portal gun, with which you can shoot two portals at specific places, and then you can go through them, and thus you have to solve all kinds of puzzles. The game later introduces buttons, cubes that can be placed on buttons, launchers, all kinds of liquids that pass through your portals and much more.</p>
            <p>The game is very long and full of unexpected twists and turns, the story is very elaborate.</p>

            <p>This was also a game I played a lot with my dad when I was a little.</p>
            <p>This game is basically a tower defense game fundamentally reimagined. Zombies come from the right and you have to plant plants that shoot them. There are 3 locations in the game, each of them has night and day versions, which always changes the gameplay a little.</p>
            <p>New plants and new zombies are constantly being intruduced during the game, so you can't get bored. Even mini-games are unlocked as you progress the game, so there will still be content after you finish the story mode.</p>

            <p>I bought this game as soon as I bought my first VR. I still play it when I have time and the game has some new interesting content</p>
            <p>This is a virtual reality game where you have to rhythmically cut the cubes flying towards you in the direction of the arrows that appear on them with the sword of the color of the cube. (huh). You can play it alone or with friends or even with strangers online. The game has amazing graphics, it's very good at lighting.</p>
            <p>If you buy a VR, this should be the first game you play</p>

            <p>It's a story based 3D survival game. I think this game is one of the reason I started making <a href="#projects">my own survival game</a>.</p>
            <p>In this game, you are a researcher who has crash-landed on an alien planet, that's mostly water. The goal of the game is to discover the planet and then get out alive.</p>
            <p>It has an impressive world of life, amazing graphics and a cool story</p> Å±

            <p>Nowadays, I play it very rarely, usually with friends when there is something new. I used to play this every single day on the family Xbox360.</p>
            <p>I think everyone knows this game. It takes place in a world where everything is built from cubes. almost everything can be destroyed, placed, moved and, thanks to this, almost everything can be built in it. It also has survival and creative modes. In survival mode, your goal is to have a base, equip yourself with the best equipment, and then defeat the Ender Dragon. Then, of course, you can still collect all kinds of advancements, such as collect a diamonds, breed animals, etc... In creative mode, you can access all the cubes and tools and create whatever you want out of them while flying.</p>
            <p>The game gets updates almost every year, so you can only get bored after many many years.</p>
